#Developing a webshop in which customers can buy products. 

> Implementing some concepts and relations

##Directive
1. Some products might be hybrids between these two types
    * subscriptions with a monthly price
    * one-time purchases with a one-off price
2. The products may also have discounts
    * which can be one-off 
    * or monthly  
3. If a customer buys multiple products at the same time, we should be able to easily calculate the total price of these products.
4. Write some code 
    * in which you model the products and their prices
    * in which you implement an easy way to calculate the total price of a set of products. 

####Suggestion
Try to make the code
simple and easy to understand. You have total freedom in how you solve this problem and you
can use as many classes as you deem fit.
